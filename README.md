# hive-mind
This is a game written in JavaScript. It is meant to be built around the
immense strategic challenges that bees go through every day in order to
create a stable hive environment.

### Ideas for future development:
* Create ants, bears, mice, and other invaders
* Create a broader map and universe to explore
* Include flowers that need to be tended and harvested for honey
* Reward the player for helping the flowers and have the flowers reproduce
* Manage resources and create a huge bee colony
* Add obstacles later in the game, such as pesticides
* Add elements that raise awareness of the modern issues that keep killing off
bee colonies.
